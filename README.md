# Validate-Input-Function
My validate input code that I created in C++


Function validates integer input from user, will take two
integers as parameters, a minimum value and maximum value and will 
reprompt user to enter a valid integer between 
min and max until user chooses a valid integer. Function will return the
valid integer.
